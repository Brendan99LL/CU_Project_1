# Welcome to the Wonderful World of Prescription Drugs! 

<ul>
    <li>Prescription medications have become a mainstream tool in the treatment of various health conditions in diverse patient demographics.</li>
    <li>More than 131 million people, about 66% of all adults in the United States, use prescription medications.</li>
    <li>The great majority of adults who have one of five common chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, arthritis, and cancer) use prescription medications.</li>
</ul>

## What are Drug Classes?

There are many medications used to treat various conditions.
More than one medication can treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, acid reflux, etc..  Drug classes separate the many medications on the market based on their use, composition, and how they work inside the body to have their effect.

**Fun Fact # 1**

<ol>
    <li>Many medications in a similar drug class have the same suffixes.
        <ul>
            <li>Medications ending with "-statin" are used to treat high cholesterol.</li>

            </p>
            <li>Medications ending with "-pril" are used to treat high blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Medications ending with "-prazole" are used to treat acid reflux.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Data for the top 200 prescription medications filled from 2013-2021 has been filtered to show only the top 10 drugs that have been filled each year.  These medications are the primary focus for the illustrated data to come.
</p>

<p>
The following graphics show the top 10 medication classes that were filled in 2013 based on the top 10 drugs that were commonly filled that year.

<p>
Since only data for top 200 prescriptions filled for years 2013-2021 were available, the pie charts are used to show the trend of what drug classes have been commonly filled at the start, middle, and end of the available years.
</p>
<p>
A common drug class that has been filled through out the years include medications used to treat high blood pressure (anti-hypertensive), high cholesterol, and high blood sugar (anti-diabetic).  These medication classes are important to conider when looking at these charts because these three classes are used to prevent heart failure.
</p>
<p>
Since 2013, at least 60% of the top medications filled have been used to treat conditions that could potentially lead to heart failure if not kept in check.
</p>
<p>
It may seem that the numbers are similar in each pie chart, but this shows a more troubling issue in that most people in the United States that use prescription medications are using them to prevent heart failure; to treat medical conditions that may have negative effects on the heart if not treated properly.
</p>
<p>
Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and most racial/ethnic groups in the United States.  About 660,000 people in the U.S. die from heart disease every year.  With how serious heart disease is, and the urgency of preventing this condition, it is no surprise that the most common drug classes that have been filled over the years have been medications used to treat conditions that can effect the heart.
